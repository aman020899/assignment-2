          <p class="item-name">Chicken</p>
          <p>
            simple Indian chicken curry is made in the style common to the
            hamlets in Konkan, along the west coast of India. Using bone-in
            chicken lends the meat a richer, gamey flavor that's in keeping with
            how this dish was traditionally made, using free-roaming birds. A
            heavy hand with spices, including turmeric, coriander, cumin, and
            cinnamon, plus plenty of chili, leaves this dish intensely flavorful
            and fiery. Serve it over white rice or with bhakris (a type of
            unleavened rice bread) to soak up all the sauce.<a href="#top"

          <p class="item-name">Beef</p>
          <p>
            beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh
            of calves. The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special
            beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean,
            bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy
            white, and well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft,
            porous, and red; the less desirable mature beef has hard white
            bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are improved by aging.<a

            ushi, a staple rice dish of Japanese cuisine, consisting of cooked
            rice flavoured with vinegar and a variety of vegetable, egg, or raw
            seafood garnishes and served cold. Restaurants specializing in sushi
            abound in Japan, where subtleties of preparation find a
            discriminating clientele, and the dish has gained popularity in the
            United States.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a>
